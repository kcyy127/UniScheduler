# UniScheduler
---

A course-centered scheduling app for college students.

## About the project

### Motive

I had a hard time keeping track of my rather dispersed college schedule and couldn't find an app that would perfectly suit my needs, so decided to design one myself. 

## Features

### Main

Users register accounts and choose their uni

Users choose course sections offered in the current quarter/ semester

...which will update course times to their schedule

Tasks can be affiliated to enrolled courses

and their statuses tracked & updated

When deleting courses, the database wipes away all affiliated events & tasks

## Future goals

-  Automating the process of updating uni schedules, courses, and sections in the database
- Create appearance themes
- App icon
